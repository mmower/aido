  option is an option whose value is a vector of the form [:fn/name ...] or [:fn*/name ...]. In this
  case 'name' should be the name of a function passed to the compile function. Where the name is in
  the 'fn' namespace the replacement is a function call. Where the name is in the 'fn*' namespace the
  replacement is the result of calling the function. Hence [:fn*/name ...] does a dymamic replacement
  at compile time and [:fn/name ...] does a dynamic replacement each time the behaviour tree is walked.

  Note that, in order that behaviour trees can be serialised to EDN where a dynamic replacement is
  created the function is added as metadata to the value. This means that the function will need to
  be regenerated each time the tree is deserialised. Compile time replacements are replacements by
  values that can be serialised."
